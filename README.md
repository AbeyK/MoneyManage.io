# MoneyManage.io

The MoneyManage budget tool helps the user allocate his or her funds to minimize wasteful spending and reach financial milestones. It uses countrywide datasets to generate default expenditures for multiple household spending categories that correspond with the user’s income and preferences. Using user inputs, MoneyManage generates charts that map the user’s current spending ratios, a “recommended” spending chart, and a 5 year plan to display the feasibility of the user’s wishes. The user may then “lock” certain expenditures that he does not wish to change and adjust others to meet his goals.
